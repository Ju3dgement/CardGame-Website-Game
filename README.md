# Quest of the round tableop game: https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/360/quests-of-the-round-table 

Summary:
This project is a turn-based, quest-driven multiplayer game inspired by Arthurian legends, initially developed with a text-based interface using a Test-Driven Development (TDD) approach. The game logic is fully decoupled from the interface, allowing for seamless transition to a web-based version. It includes a variety of quest and event cards, with a focus on structured scenario-based testing using tools like Cucumber for behavior-driven development. The latest iteration transforms the game into a web interface where players can interact in separate browser windows on the same machine. Automated UI and regression testing are performed using Selenium to ensure game stability and functionality across interactions.
